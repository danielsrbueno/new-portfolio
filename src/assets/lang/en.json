Since then, I have been constantly striving to improve my skills. This passion led me to apply for the Systems Development course at Etec Jaraguá, alongside my high school education. Fortunately, I was accepted, achieving the honor of securing second place.",

I work on projects using ReactJS, NodeJS, NextJS, among other technologies, and I am eager to explore new languages, tools, and frameworks. I plan to apply for internship positions to gain professional experience, as I have not yet worked in this field.",

Beyond technology, I have a passion for weight training, fighting Muay Thai, biking, camping, listening to music, going to church, and watching dividends being deposited into my account."
